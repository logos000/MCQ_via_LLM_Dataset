### The dataset for Generating Multiple Choice Questions from Scientific Literature via Large Language Models

Welcome to the repository for the **MCQ_via_LLM_Dataset**, a specialized dataset designed for generating high-quality Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) from scientific literature using Large Language Models (LLMs). This dataset serves as a crucial resource for researchers and developers working at the intersection of natural language processing and scientific data interpretation.

## Overview

In recent years, the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new horizons in the field of natural language processing, particularly in the automated generation of educational content. Our study introduces a systematic approach to creating high-quality MCQs from scientific literature, leveraging the power of LLMs.

## About the Study

The primary objective of this research is to explore the potential of LLMs in generating diverse and accurate MCQs from scientific texts, with a specific focus on materials science. We have curated a specialized dataset by extracting information from extensive scientific literature, emphasizing five critical tasks:

1. **Common Science Knowledge Q&A**: Questions designed to test foundational scientific knowledge.
2. **Digital Data Extraction**: MCQs that assess the ability to extract and interpret data from digital formats.
3. **Detailed Understanding**: Questions that require a deep comprehension of scientific concepts and literature.
4. **Reasoning and Interpretation**: MCQs focused on logical reasoning and the interpretation of scientific findings.
5. **Safety Judgments**: Questions assessing knowledge and application of safety protocols in scientific contexts.

### Methodology

Our approach involves using carefully crafted prompts with LLMs to automate the generation of MCQs. The process includes several key steps:

- **Data Collection**: Extracting relevant scientific content from a wide range of literature in the field of materials science.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Designing prompts that guide LLMs to generate high-quality, contextually accurate MCQs.
- **Validation**: Conducting rigorous validation to ensure the relevance, accuracy, and educational value of the generated MCQs.
